window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the beginning, it was just about the money. Then things got personal. This is the story that Ed Gradduk tells his best friend, private investigator Lincoln Perry. Ed is on the run, hiding from the police who are looking to arrest him for arson and murder. When Gradduk is killed in a brutal confrontation with the Cleveland police, Perry is shaken. How could this have happened to his friend? With his trademark grit and determination, Perry sets out to understand the forces that brought down Ed Gradduk.</p> <p><i>Sorrow’s Anthem</i> is marked by a sure-handed exploration of both character and its relationship to crime. It more than delivers on the promise of Tonight I Said Goodbye and establishes Michael Koryta as the top young mystery writer in America today.</p>";
