No persons of interest. Just a girl who was alive one day and dead the next.</i></b></p> <p>Some places seem too beautiful to be touched by horror. Summit Lake, nestled in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains, is that kind of place. But two weeks ago, Becca Eckersley, a first-year law student and daughter of a powerful attorney, was brutally murdered there. Now the town is reeling with grief, and the police are baffled<b>.</b></p> <p><b>“An exciting debut, with all the right touches, captivating from the first page to the last.” --Steve Berry, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author</b></p> <p>At first, investigative reporter Kelsey Castle thinks of the assignment as a fluff piece. But the savagery of the crime, and the efforts to keep it quiet, hint at something far more sinister than a random attack by a stranger. As Kelsey digs deeper, despite danger and warnings, she feels a growing connection to the dead girl. And the more she learns about Becca’s friendships, her love life - and her secrets - the more convinced she becomes that walking in Becca’s footsteps could lead her out of her own dark past....</p> <p><b>“A swift, outstanding debut.” --Robert Dugoni, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author</b></p> <p><b>“Fans of contemporary suspense will enjoy this brisk read.” </b><b><i>--Booklist</i></b></p>";
