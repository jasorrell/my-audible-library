At every turn, the combatants went for the jugular, whether they were facing down rivals in the other party or their own.</p> <p>Bestselling authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes give listeners their first graphic view of the characters, their motivations, and their innermost thoughts as they battled to claim the ultimate prize and define a political era. Based on real-time interviews with more than 150 insiders—from the Trump, Harris, and Biden inner circles, as well as party leaders and operatives—<i>Fight </i>delivers the vivid and stunning tale of an election unlike any other.</p> <p>In the end, Trump overcame voters’ concerns about his personal flaws by tapping into a deep vein of dissatisfaction with the direction of the country. At the same time, Democrats struggled to connect with an electorate that felt gaslit by Biden’s insistence that he had delivered economic prosperity—and his pledge to be a “bridge” president. He tore his party asunder, leaving destroyed personal relationships in his wake, as he clung to power. And when he gave it up, he kneecapped Harris by demanding unprecedented loyalty from her.</p> <p>As Allen and Parnes have done in the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Shattered</i> and <i>Lucky</i>, they provide listeners with a skeleton key to the rooms where it all happened, revealing a story more shocking than previously reported.</p>";
