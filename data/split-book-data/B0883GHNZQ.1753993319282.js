Set in 1976, on the eve of her bid to become New York State’s first female senator, <i>Bella Bella</i> finds this larger-than-life, truth-slinging, groundbreaking, hat-wearing icon squirreled away in the bathroom of a midtown hotel awaiting that night’s election results while a coterie of family and celebs await her entrance. Directing is Kimberly Senior (<i>The Niceties</i>).</p>";
