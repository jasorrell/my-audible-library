window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The US Central Intelligence Agency is no stranger to conspiracy and allegations of corruption. Across the globe, violent coups have been orchestrated, high-profile targets kidnapped, and world leaders dispatched at the hands of CIA agents. During the 1960's, on domestic soil, the methods used to protect their interests and themselves, at the expense of the American people, were no less ruthless. </p> <p>In <i>CIA Rogues and the Killing of the Kennedys</i>, Patrick Nolan fearlessly investigates the CIA’s involvement in the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy - why the brothers needed to die and how rogue intelligence agents orchestrated history’s most infamous conspiracy. </p> <p>Nolan furthers the research of leading forensic scientists, historians, and scholars who agree that there remain serious unanswered questions regarding the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, fifty years ago, and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. He revisits and refutes what is currently known about Lee Harvey Oswald and Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, and offers listeners a compelling profile of the CIA’s Richard Helms, an amoral master of clandestine operations with a chip on his shoulder. </p> <p>Bolstered by a foreword by Dr. Henry C. Lee, one of the world’s foremost forensic authorities, <i>CIA Rogues and the Killing of the Kennedys</i> is an unmatched effort in forensic research and detective work. As the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination approaches, Nolan has made a significant contribution to the literature on that fateful day in Dallas, as well as shed light on that dark night at the Ambassador Hotel. Listeners interested in conspiracy, the Kennedy family, or American history will find this audiobook invaluable. </p>";
