window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the internationally best-selling author of <i>My Lovely Wife</i> and <i>He Started It </i>comes a twisted, entertaining novella about a dog walker swept into a criminal investigation when her client winds up dead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shelby works as a dog walker in northern California, and she’s just finished up her bi-weekly trip to the park with a husky named Pluto. When she brings him back to his house, she finds his owner - Todd Burke, a well-known local businessman and founder of an organic supplements company - lying on the bathroom floor, dead. A detective arrives on the scene. As she interviews Shelby, the body is inspected by a medical examiner, and more cops search Todd’s home, it becomes clear that the victim’s life was less picture-perfect than his clean-cut persona might lead you to believe.&nbsp;</p>";
