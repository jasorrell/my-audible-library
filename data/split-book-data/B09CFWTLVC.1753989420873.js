window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Secrets of Us</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Best of Friends</i></b><b> comes a novella of deceit, desperation, and how one little mistake can unravel a life. </b></p> <p>When overwhelmed stay-at-home mom Alexis finds herself at odds with her husband after she’s charged with a DUI, she is given one chance to get her family back: complete AA and admit her faults. The problem is, she’s never had a drinking problem and has no idea what caused the blackout that led to her arrest. Still, she’s committed to working through the program, if that’s what it takes to be reunited with her two young children. But when she connects with a new friend, Farrah - a confident, successful powerhouse of a woman Alexis can’t help but idolize - she’s empowered to take a closer look at her husband’s role in her downfall. What she finds shocks her to her core, quickly spiraling into something more sinister than she ever imagined.&nbsp;</p>";
