window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Alafair Burke - <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the runaway hit <i>The Wife</i> - comes another twisty tale of domestic noir. When a prominent Manhattan lawyer is murdered, two estranged sisters - one the dead man’s widow, the other his ex - must set aside mistrust and old resentments...but can they escape their past?</p> <p>Though Chloe was the younger of the two Taylor sisters, she always seemed to be in charge. She was the honor-roll student with big dreams and an even bigger work ethic.&nbsp;Nicky was always restless...and more than a little reckless - the opposite of her ambitious little sister. She floated from job to job and man to man and stayed close to home in Cleveland.</p> <p>For a while, it seemed like both sisters had found happiness. Chloe earned a scholarship to an Ivy League school and moved to New York City, where she landed a coveted publishing job. Nicky married promising young attorney&nbsp;Adam Macintosh and gave birth to a baby boy they named Ethan. The Taylor sisters became virtual strangers.</p> <p>Now, more than 15 years later, their lives are drastically different - and&nbsp;Chloe is married to Adam. When he’s murdered by an intruder at the couple’s East Hampton beach house,&nbsp;Chloe reluctantly allows her teenaged stepson’s biological mother - her estranged sister, Nicky - back into her life. But when the police begin to treat Ethan as a suspect in his father’s death, the two sisters are forced to unite...and to confront the truth behind family secrets they have tried to bury in the past.</p>";
