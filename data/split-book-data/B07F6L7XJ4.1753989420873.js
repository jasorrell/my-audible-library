Only Wednesday Martin, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Primates of Park Avenue</i>, could combine anthropology, anecdote, and adventure to hilariously right an anatomic wrong.</p> <p>For millennia, the woman’s most sensitive part has been maligned, misrepresented, and cut out entirely from medical texts, our culture, and our general understanding of female sexuality.
