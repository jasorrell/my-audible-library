window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Amazon Charts best-selling series.</b></p> <p>From the author of <i>Dead Certain</i> comes a twisting novel of friendship, love, and marriage - and all their cunning and deadly betrayals.</p> <p>Back in 1986, Clint Broden was a novice New York defense attorney building a family with his wife, Anne, and impatient for his career to take off. That’s when his defense of his closest friend, Nick Zamora, made headlines. In spite of his lingering suspicions that his soul mate since childhood had a secret, Clint was dedicated to believing Nick hadn’t murdered his new bride.</p> <p>Three decades later, Clint is now the celebrated go-to attorney for the rich and famous. Nick is a lauded literary superstar living his dreams in Los Angeles. Though separated by 30 years and 3,000 miles, they’re still bound by one thing - the trial that tested the limits of their friendship.</p> <p>After all these years, the last thing Clint expects is to be pulled back into Nick’s disruptive life. But this time, his motives for getting involved might be different from proving his old friend’s innocence. It could be Clint’s last chance to force a reckoning with the sins of the past.</p>";
