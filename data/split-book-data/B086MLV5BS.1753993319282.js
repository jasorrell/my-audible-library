Although thoroughly unpredictable, it’s inspired by true events.</p> <p>Created using the same compelling mix of savvy plotting, rapid pacing, and clever conundrums that turned the first four Kyle Achilles books into international best sellers, <i>Boundless Ambition</i> gives you heroes to love, villains to hate, and puzzles to solve. It’s a story destined to delight both new comers and avid Tim Tigner fans.</p>";
