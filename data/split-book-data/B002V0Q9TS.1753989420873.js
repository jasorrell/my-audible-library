window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Number one New York Times best seller.</p> <p>“A big sweeping novel of friendship and marriage” (<i>The Washington Post</i>) by the celebrated author of <i>The Prince of Tides</i> and <i>The Great Santini</i>.</p> <p>Leopold Bloom King has been raised in a family shattered - and shadowed - by tragedy. Lonely and adrift, he searches for something to sustain him and finds it among a tightly knit group of outsiders. Surviving marriages happy and troubled, unrequited loves and unspoken longings, hard-won successes and devastating breakdowns, as well as Charleston, South Carolina’s dark legacy of racism and class divisions, these friends will endure until a final test forces them to face something none of them are prepared for.</p> <p>Spanning two turbulent decades, <i>South of Broad</i> is Pat Conroy at his finest: a masterpiece from a great American writer whose passion for life and language knows no bounds.</p>";
