window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From celebrated <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author and winner of the Pulitzer Prize Rick Bragg comes a poignant and wryly funny collection of essays on life in the South. Keenly observed and written with his insightful and deadpan sense of humor, Bragg explores enduring Southern truths about home, place, spirit, table, and the regions' varied geographies, including his native Alabama, Cajun country, and the Gulf Coast. Everything is explored, from regional obsessions with college football and fishing to mayonnaise and spoonbread to the simple beauty of a fish on the hook. Collected from over a decade of his writing, with many never-before-published essays written specifically for this edition, <i>My Southern Journey</i> is an entertaining and engaging listen, especially for Southerners (or Southerners at heart) and anyone who appreciates great writing. </p>";
