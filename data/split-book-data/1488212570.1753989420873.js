Online</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>“10 Books to Cozy Up With This December” (</b><b><i>PopSugar</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>A popular sorority girl. An unsolved murder. A campus podcast with chilling repercussions.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lucas Vega is obsessed with&nbsp;the death of&nbsp;Candace Swain, who left a sorority party one night and never came back.&nbsp;Her body was found after two weeks, but the case has grown cold. Three years later while interning at the medical examiner's, Lucas discovers new information, but&nbsp;the police&nbsp;are not&nbsp;interested.</p> <p>Lucas knows he has several credible pieces of the puzzle. He just isn't sure how they fit together. So he creates a podcast&nbsp;to revisit&nbsp;Candace's last hours. Then he encourages listeners to crowdsource what they remember and invites guest lecturer Regan Merritt, a&nbsp;former US marshal, to&nbsp;come on and share her expertise.</p> <p>New&nbsp;tips come in&nbsp;that convince Lucas and Regan they are onto something. Then, shockingly, one of the podcast&nbsp;callers&nbsp;turns up dead.&nbsp;Another&nbsp;hints at&nbsp;Candace's secret life, a much darker picture than Lucas imagined — and one&nbsp;that implicates other sorority sisters. Regan uses her own resources to&nbsp;bolster&nbsp;their theory and&nbsp;learns that Lucas&nbsp;is hiding his own secret. The pressure is on to solve the murder, but first Lucas must come clean about his real motives in pursuing this podcast — before the killer silences him forever.</p>";
