window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An Amazon Charts bestseller.</b></p> <p><b>A double life with a single purpose: revenge.</b></p> <p>Jane’s days at a Midwest insurance company are perfectly ordinary. She blends in well, unremarkably pretty in her floral-print dresses and extra efficient at her low-level job. She’s just the kind of woman middle manager Steven Hepsworth likes - meek, insecure, and willing to defer to a man. No one has any idea who Jane really is. Least of all Steven.</p> <p>But plain Jane is hiding something. And Steven’s bringing out the worst in her.</p> <p>Nothing can distract Jane from going straight for his heart: allowing herself to be seduced into Steven’s bed, to insinuate herself into his career and his family, and to expose all his dirty secrets. It’s time for Jane to dig out everything that matters to Steven. So she can take it all away.</p> <p>Just as he did to her.</p>";
