window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller</b></p> <p><b>A deeply affecting coming-of-age memoir about family, love, loss, basketball - and life itself - by the beloved author of </b><b><i>The Prince of Tides </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>The Great Santini</i></b></p> <p>During one unforgettable season as a Citadel cadet, Pat Conroy becomes part of a basketball team that is ultimately destined to fail. And yet for a military kid who grew up on the move, the Bulldogs provide a sanctuary from the cold, abrasive father who dominates his life- and a crucible for becoming his own man.</p> <p>With all the drama and incandescence of his best-selling fiction, Conroy re-creates his pivotal senior year as captain of the Citadel Bulldogs. He chronicles the highs and lows of that fateful 1966-67 season, his tough disciplinarian coach, the joys of winning, and the hard-won lessons of losing. Most of all, he recounts how a group of boys came together as a team, playing a sport that would become a metaphor for a man whose spirit could never be defeated.</p>";
