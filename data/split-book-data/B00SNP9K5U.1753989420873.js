window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In February 1864, 500 Union prisoners of war arrived at the Confederate stockade at Anderson Station, Georgia. Andersonville, as it was later known, would become legendary for its brutality and mistreatment, with the highest mortality rate--more than 30 percent--of any Civil War prison. Fourteen months later 32,000 men were imprisoned there. Most of the prisoners suffered greatly because of poor organization, meager supplies, the federal government's refusal to exchange prisoners, and the cruelty of men supporting a government engaged in a losing battle for survival. Who was responsible for allowing so much squalor, mismanagement, and waste at Andersonville? </p><p>Looking for an answer, Ovid Futch cuts through charges and countercharges that have made the camp a subject of bitter controversy. He examines diaries and firsthand accounts of prisoners, guards, and officers and both Confederate and federal government records (including the transcript of the trial of Capt. Henry Wirz, the alleged \"fiend of Andersonville\"). </p><p>First published in 1968, this groundbreaking volume has never gone out of print.</p>";
