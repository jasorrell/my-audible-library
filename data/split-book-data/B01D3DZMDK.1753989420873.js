window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The must-have companion to Bill O'Reilly's historical docudrama <i>Legends and Lies: The Patriots</i>, an exciting and eye-opening look at the Revolutionary War through the lives of its leaders </p> <p>The American Revolution was neither inevitable nor a unanimous cause. It pitted neighbors against each other as loyalists and colonial rebels faced off for their lives and futures. These were the times that tried men's souls: No one was on stable ground, and few could be trusted. </p> <p>Through the fascinating tales of the first Americans, <i>Legends and Lies: The Patriots</i> reveals the contentious arguments that turned friends into foes and the country into a war zone. From the riots over a child's murder that led to the Boston Massacre to the suspicious return of Ben Franklin, the \"First American\"; from the Continental Army's first victory under George Washington's leadership to the little-known Southern guerilla campaign of \"Swamp Fox\" Francis Marion and the celebration of America's first Christmas, <i>The Patriots</i> recreates the amazing combination of resourcefulness, perseverance, strategy, and luck that led to this country's creation. </p> <p>Told in the same fast-paced, immersive narrative as the first Legends and Lies, <i>The Patriots</i> is an irresistible, adventure-packed journey back into one of the most storied moments of our nation's rich history. </p> <p>Introduction read by Bill O'Reilly. </p>";
