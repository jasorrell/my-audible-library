window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For the first time Gacy’s lawyer and confidant tells his chilling tale of how he defended an American serial killer. </b></p> <p><i>“Sam, could you do me a favor?” </i></p> <p>Thus begins a story that has now become part of America's true-crime hall of fame. It is a gory, grotesque tale befitting a Stephen King novel. It is also a David and Goliath saga - the story of a young lawyer fresh from the public defender's office whose first client in private practice turns out to be the worst serial killer in our nation's history. This is a gripping true crime narrative that reenacts the gruesome killings and the famous trial that shocked a nation. </p>";
