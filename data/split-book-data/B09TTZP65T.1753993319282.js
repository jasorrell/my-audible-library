Sure, thereâ€™s the unpaid overtime, the office politics, and the ever-present threat of layoffs. But you get to game!</p> <p>But when a small third-party testing team is assigned to work on<i> Blade Skill Online - </i>a highly anticipated virtual reality MMORPG - they quickly find that some bugs are more serious than others, and some truly insidious features are \"working as intended\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>If our intrepid QA team wants to survive the launch cycle, they're going to have to break this game.
