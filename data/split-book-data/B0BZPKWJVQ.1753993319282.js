Money has been tight after the bushfires, and it’s about to get tighter if they can’t find a way to pay their suppliers to keep their business going and keep the bank from foreclosing on their property. So when Jackie receives a mysterious phone call offering them $100,000 to let someone bury a body on their land, the answer isn’t as simple as they thought it would be.</p> <p>It’s a deal that could change their lives. But when a woman in the next town over goes missing, it’s a deal that could ruin them forever.</p>";
