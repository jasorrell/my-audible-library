window.bookSummaryJSON = "Before he gained wide fame as a novelist, Ernest Hemingway established his literary reputation with his short stories. Set in the varied landscapes of Spain, Africa, and the American Midwest, this definitive audio collection traces the development and maturation of Hemingway's distinct and revolutionary storytelling style - from the plain bald language of his first story to his mastery of seamless prose that contained a spare, eloquent pathos, as well as a sense of expansive solitude. These stories showcase the singular talent of a master, the most important American writer of the 20th century. <p><i>The Short Stories, Volume 1</i> features Stacy Keach reading favorites including:<br></p> <li>The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</li> <li>The Capital of the World</li> <li>The Snows of Kilimanjaro</li> <li>Old Man at the Bridge</li> <li>Up in Michigan</li> <li>On the Quai at Smyrna</li> <li>Indian Camp</li> <li>The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife</li> <li>The End of Something</li> <li>The Three-Day Blow</li> <li>The Battler</li> <li>A Very Short Story</li> <li>Soldier's Home</li> <li>The Revolutionist</li> <li>Mr. and Mrs. Elliot</li> <li>Cat in the Rain</li> <li>Out of Season</li> <li>Cross-Country Snow</li>";
