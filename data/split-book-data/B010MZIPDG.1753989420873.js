window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The definitive investigation into the greatest aviation mystery in history, with a startling hypothesis about who took the plane, where they took it, and how. On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared. A year later, still no trace of the plane - or the 239 people onboard - has been found. But why? In <i>The Plane That Wasn't There</i>, science journalist and CNN aviation analyst Jeff Wise sweeps aside the conspiracy theories and misconceptions and lays out, with clear concision, just what we know about the plane's fate - and what we don't. The deeper into the technical details one delves, Wise reports, the stranger the case seems. He proposes that in order to make sense of the data we have, a radical new hypothesis ought to be considered - one that he lays out in gripping detail, complete with modus operandi, flight path, possible perpetrators, and a startling destination. Jeff Wise is a science journalist specializing in aviation and psychology. A licensed pilot of gliders and light airplanes, he has also written for <i>New York</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Businessweek</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Details</i>, and many others. His 2011 <i>Popular Mechanics</i> story on the fate of Air France 447 was named one of the Top 10 Longreads of 2011. His last book was <i>Extreme Fear: The Science of Your Mind in Danger</i>. A native of Massachusetts, he lives in New York City with his wife and two sons. </p>";
