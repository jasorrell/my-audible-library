He tells jokes with the kind of mocking humor that gets a laugh yet can be safely shared in school. After all, even great schools have bad days - when lesson plans fall through, disgruntled parents complain, kids throw temper tantrums because they have to use the same spoon for their applesauce and mashed potatoes, and, of course, dealing with...<i>The Horror! The Horror!...</i>dreaded assessments.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ranging from practical topics like social media use in the classÂ­room and parent-teacher conferences to more lighthearted sections such as \"Pickup and Dropoff: An Exercise in Humanity\" and \"School Supplies: Yes, We Really Need All That Stuff\",<i> Go See the Principal </i>offers comic relief, inspiration, and advice to those who need it the most.</p>";
