window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b>&nbsp;<b>and&nbsp;</b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b>&nbsp;best seller! </b></p> <p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Maureen Johnson delivers the witty and pulse-pounding conclusion to the Truly Devious series as Stevie Bell solves the mystery that has haunted Ellingham Academy for over 75 years. </b></p> <p>Ellingham Academy must be cursed. Three people are now dead. One, a victim of either&nbsp;a prank gone wrong or a murder. Another, dead by misadventure. And now, an accident in Burlington has claimed another life. All three in the wrong place at the wrong time. All at the exact moment of Stevie's greatest triumph....</p> <p>She knows who Truly Devious is. She's solved it. The greatest case of the century.&nbsp;</p> <p>At least, she thinks she has. With this latest tragedy, it's hard to concentrate on the past. Not only has someone died in town, but David disappeared of his own free will and is up to something. Stevie is sure that somehow - somehow - all these things connect. The three deaths in the present. The deaths in the past. The missing Alice Ellingham and the missing David Eastman. Somewhere in this place of riddles and puzzles there must be answers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then another accident occurs as a massive storm heads toward Vermont. This is too much for the parents and administrators. Ellingham Academy is evacuated. Obviously, it's time for Stevie to do something stupid. It's time to stay on the mountain and face the storm - and a murderer.</p> <p>In the tantalizing finale to the Truly Devious trilogy, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Maureen Johnson expertly tangles her dual narrative threads and ignites an explosive end for all who’ve walked through Ellingham Academy.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Praise for the </b><b><i>Truly Devious </i></b><b>series:</b></p> <p>\"Readers, hang tight: there’s one more round to come, and if the signs are right, it'll be to die for.\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review)</p> <p>\"The Agatha Christie-like ecosystem pairs with lacerating contemporary wit, and alternating past and present scenes makes for a multilayered, modern detective story.\" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)</p> <p>\"Remember the first time reading Harry Potter and knowing it was special?
