window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER</b></p> <p><b>Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spearheaded the Trump Administration’s most significant foreign policy breakthroughs. Now, he reveals how he did it, and how it could happen again.</b></p> <p>As the only four-year national security member of President Trump’s Cabinet, he worked to impose crushing pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran, avert a nuclear crisis with North Korea, deliver unmatched support for Israel, and bring peace to the Middle East. Drawing on his commitment to America’s founding principles and his Christian faith, his efforts to promote religious freedom around the world were unequaled in American diplomatic history. Most importantly, he led a much-needed generational transformation of America's relationship with China.</p> <p>Blending remarkable and often humorous stories of his interactions with world leaders and unmatched analysis of geopolitics,&nbsp;<i>Never Give an Inch</i>&nbsp;tells of how Pompeo helped the Trump Administration craft the America First approach that upended Washington's wisdom—and made him America’s enemies’ worst nightmare. It is a raw account of what it took to deliver winning outcomes, including answers to questions like:</p> <p>--Why Trump thought his Secretary of State was too tough on China</p> <p>--What he said to Kim Jong-un that set him apart from other American negotiators</p> <p>--How Mike Pence could have lost his spot on the 2020 ticket</p> <p>--Who still has him high on their list of enemies</p> <p>A road map of the trends and players shaping the world today,&nbsp;<i>Never Give an Inch</i>&nbsp;is more than a historical review of the Trump Administration's greatest victories. It is essential listening for anyone who wants to understand the challenges of the future. And it is an inspirational story of leadership through dangerous times that will leave you with a greater appreciation for America.</p>";
