window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This program includes a prologue and epilogue read by the author.</p> <p><b>From </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b> <b>culture reporter Dave Itzkoff comes the definitive audiobook biography of Robin Williams - a compelling portrait of one of America’s most beloved and misunderstood entertainers. </b></p> <p>From his rapid-fire stand-up comedy riffs to his breakout role in <i>Mork &amp; Mindy</i> and his Academy Award-winning performance in <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, Robin Williams was a singularly innovative and beloved entertainer. He often came across as a man possessed, holding forth on culture and politics while mixing in personal revelations - all with mercurial, tongue-twisting intensity as he inhabited and shed one character after another with lightning speed.&nbsp;</p> <p>But as Dave Itzkoff shows in this revelatory biography, Williams’ comic brilliance masked a deep well of conflicting emotions and self-doubt, which he drew upon in his comedy and in celebrated films like <i>Dead Poets Society</i>; <i>Good Morning, Vietnam</i>; <i>The Fisher King</i>; <i>Aladdin</i>; and <i>Mrs. Doubtfire</i>, where he showcased his limitless gift for improvisation to bring to life a wide range of characters. And in <i>Good Will Hunting </i>he gave an intense and controlled performance that revealed the true range of his talent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Itzkoff also shows how Williams struggled mightily with addiction and depression - topics he discussed openly while performing and during interviews - and with a debilitating condition at the end of his life that affected him in ways his fans never knew. Drawing on more than a hundred original interviews with family, friends, and colleagues as well as extensive archival research, <i>Robin</i> is a fresh and original look at a man whose work touched so many lives.</p>";
