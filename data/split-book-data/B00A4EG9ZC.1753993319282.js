window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The adventures of Harry Kemelman’s unassuming hero have been hailed by critics and fans alike. Kemelman is celebrated for his absorbing plots and his warm and knowledgeable depiction of Jews and Judaism. Rabbi David Small must step into action when Barnard’s Crossings’ most notorious anti-Semite is found dead, and several members of his congregation are suspected. The murder victim is a cantankerous curmudgeon who has offended many members of this close-knit Jewish community. It will take all of Rabbi Small’s cool-headed logic and tenacity to solve the case and redeem his standing in the temple. Narrator George Guidall was personally approved for this project by the author’s estate. With his dramatic flair, Guidall brings Rabbi David Small fully to life and makes you wish the colorful residents of Barnard’s Crossing were your own neighbors.</p>";
