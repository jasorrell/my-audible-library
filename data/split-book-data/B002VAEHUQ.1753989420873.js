window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Exclusively from Audible</b> </p> <p>For 15 years the weaver Silas Marner has plied his loom near the village of Raveloe, alone and unjustly in exile, cut off from faith and human love, he cares only for his hoard of golden guineas. But two events occur that will change his life forever; his gold disappears and a golden-haired baby girl appears. But where did she come from and who really stole the gold? This moving tale sees Silas eventually redeemed and restored to life by the unlikely means of his love for the orphan child Eppie. </p> <p>One of Eliot's most admired and loved works, <i>Silas Marner</i> is a tender and moving tale of betrayal, greed, loss, and redemption, with a finely drawn picture of early 19th-century England before the loss of the simple rural way of life. This moral tale shows the importance of valuing what really matters in life and that the hand we are dealt may ultimately lead to our happiness. Though it is Eliot's shortest book it still retains all the elements which are most recognisable and admirable about her work. </p> <p>George Eliot was one of the leading writers of the Victorian era. Her novels, largely set in provincial England, are well known for their realism and psychological insight. </p> <p><i>Narrator Biography</i> </p> <p>Beginning his career in repertory theatre, Andrew Sachs made his screen debut in 1959 in the film <i>The Night We Dropped a Clanger</i>.
