window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Declaring war on homegrown Nazis…in Newark, New Jersey.</b></p> <p>Join writer and documentary producer Greg Donahue as he explores the history of domestic Nazis on the brink of World War II and the Jewish mobsters who stood up to them in this gripping, true-life audiobook.</p> <p>In the early 1930s, pro-Nazi groups popped up across America, attempting to drum up support among recent immigrants for the fascist movement back in Europe. By 1939, a massive rally of some 20,000 homegrown Nazi supporters was held in New York City’s Madison Square Garden. While across the Hudson River in Newark, New Jersey, the town’s large German population stepped up Nazi recruitment activity. Pro-fascist groups staged parades, screened anti-Semitic films, and organized boycotts of Jewish businesses and politicians throughout the city. Complicating matters, Newark was also the epicenter of the Jewish mob.</p> <p>Abner 'Longie' Zwillman, known as the \"Al Capone of New Jersey\", had made a fortune in gambling, bootlegging, racketeering, and controlled the city’s ports and police force. Not surprisingly, this powerful Jewish gangster took exception to the Nazi’s anti-Semitic platform. In response, Zwillman helped organize a group of ex-boxers, factory workers, and students to defend the city’s Jewish interests. The group dubbed themselves the Minutemen - ready at a moment’s notice - and took to breaking up Nazi gatherings using an intimidating combination of stink bombs, baseball bats, brass knuckles, and pure chutzpah.</p> <p>Greg Donahue’s <i>The Minuteman</i> tells the story of one of Newark’s native sons - ex-prizefighter and longtime Zwillman enforcer Sidney Abramowitz, aka Nat Arno - who took over leadership of the Minutemen in 1934 and made it his personal business to put an end to what he saw as the homegrown Nazi movement’s \"anti-American\" activities. For six years, Arno and his crew of vigilantes battled Newark’s Nazis at every turn. <i>The Minuteman</i> is a story of the ethics of violence in the face of fascism - a forgotten legacy that is as relevant now as it was nearly a hundred years ago.</p> <p><b>Photos Included in Cover Art Courtesy of the Jewish Historical Society of New Jersey - Warren Grover Collection</b></p>";
