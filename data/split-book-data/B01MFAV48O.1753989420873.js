window.bookSummaryJSON = "Narrated by acclaimed British actor Edward Petherbridge. On the eve of war, Sherlock Holmes is asked by the Prime Minister of England to recover a new British superweapon that has fallen into the wrong hands. But Lucy James, an actress and Holmes's recently discovered grown daughter, has inherited the family sleuthing skills and strong-willed nature. Despite her father's objections, she insists on helping him, although several horrific murders have been linked to the weapon's disappearance. With Dr. Watson, Holmes and Lucy follow the trail to Germany, uncovering a sinister plot that puts them directly in the line of fire. Featuring appearances from real-life notables Nikola Tesla, King Edward VII, and Kaiser Wilhelm II, this electrifying new mystery puts the greatest deductive mind of his era into a race to save the Empire.";
